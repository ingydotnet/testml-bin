= Synopsis

Create `t/*.t` files with a `testml` shebang line like this:

  #!/usr/bin/env testml

  %TestML 0.1.0

  *foo == *bar

  === Test 1
  --- foo: 123
  --- bar: 123

Then run `prove` and it should just work.

Also this should work:

  testml foo.tml

= Description

This repo provides a bin script from TestML test files that can be used in a
shebang line. The `prove` command and possibly other test harness runners will
honor the shebang and run the test as TestML.

The script will determine what language and test framework that the test
expects. In this early realease, only Perl5 is supported but later it will
honor various ways to set the target language:

* `TESTML_LANG` env var
* `--lang=...` CLI option
* `.testml` config file
* Repository directory heuristics

# Installation

For now just use:

  cpanm TestML::Bin
